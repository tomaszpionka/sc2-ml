## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Feature groups A–E** implementing methodology Section 3.1 for incremental ablation:
  - Group A (`group_a_elo.py`): Dynamic K-factor Elo ratings (refactored from `elo.py`)
  - Group B (`group_b_historical.py`): Historical aggregates + new variance features (`hist_std_apm`, `hist_std_sq`)
  - Group C (`group_c_matchup.py`): Race encoding, spawn distance, map area + new map×race interaction winrate
  - Group D (`group_d_form.py`): **New** — win/loss streaks, EMA stats, activity windows (7d/30d), head-to-head records
  - Group E (`group_e_context.py`): **New** — patch version numeric, tournament match position, series game number
- `build_features(df, groups=FeatureGroup.C)` API for composable group selection and ablation
- `split_for_ml()` consuming the series-aware 80/15/5 split from `data/processing.py`
- `FeatureGroup` enum and `get_groups()` for ablation protocol (methodology Section 7.1)
- Feature group registry (`registry.py`) with lazy-loaded compute functions
- Backward-compatible wrappers in `compat.py` (`perform_feature_engineering`, `temporal_train_test_split`)
- Config constants: `EMA_ALPHA`, `ACTIVITY_WINDOW_SHORT`, `ACTIVITY_WINDOW_LONG`, `H2H_BAYESIAN_C`
- 73 new tests in `tests/test_features/` covering all groups, common primitives, registry, ablation, and compat
- `tests/helpers.py`: `make_series_df()` for Group E testing; deterministic win streaks for Player_0
- `tests/helpers_classical.py`: isolated worker for classical model reproducibility (no torch import)
- `pytest-cov` and `coverage` dev dependencies

### Changed
- `cli.py` now uses `build_features()` + `split_for_ml()` instead of monolithic `perform_feature_engineering()` + `temporal_train_test_split()`
- `temporal_train_test_split()` now emits `DeprecationWarning` (use `split_for_ml()` instead)
- Test imports updated: `from sc2ml.features import ...` replaces `from sc2ml.features.engineering import ...`

### Fixed
- **Dual-OpenMP segfault on macOS (LightGBM + PyTorch)**: LightGBM ships Homebrew `libomp.dylib`, PyTorch bundles its own `libomp.dylib`. Loading both in the same process causes a segfault at shutdown during OpenMP thread pool teardown. Fix: classical model reproducibility tests now run in a `multiprocessing.spawn` child process via `helpers_classical.py` (which never imports torch), fully isolating the two runtimes. GNN test adds `gc.collect()` + `torch.mps.empty_cache()` cleanup per `test_mps.py` pattern.

### Removed
- `features/elo.py` and `features/engineering.py` (replaced by group modules + compat wrappers)

### Added
- **Path B in-game event extraction pipeline** in `ingestion.py`: `audit_raw_data_availability()`, `extract_raw_events_from_file()`, `save_raw_events_to_parquet()`, `run_in_game_extraction()`, DuckDB loaders with `player_stats` view and `match_player_map` table
- `PLAYER_STATS_FIELD_MAP` — 39 `scoreValue*` → snake_case field mappings for tracker events
- Temporal split management in `processing.py`: `assign_series_ids()`, `create_temporal_split()`, `validate_temporal_split()`
- `player_id` column added to `flat_players` and `matches_flat` SQL views
- `get_matches_dataframe()` now accepts optional `split` parameter for filtered queries
- Config constants: `IN_GAME_DB_PATH`, `IN_GAME_PARQUET_DIR`, `IN_GAME_MANIFEST_PATH`, `IN_GAME_WORKERS`, `IN_GAME_BATCH_SIZE`, `TRAIN_RATIO`, `VAL_RATIO`, `TEST_RATIO`, `SERIES_GAP_SECONDS`
- `pyarrow` dependency for Parquet-based event storage
- 42 new tests in `src/sc2ml/data/tests/` covering ingestion and processing pipelines
- Data pipeline documentation: `src/sc2ml/data/README.md`, methodology notes

### Changed
- `slim_down_sc2_with_manifest()` now defaults to `dry_run=True` for safety

### Changed
- **Reorganized into `src/sc2ml/` package** with four subpackages: `data/`, `features/`,
  `models/`, `gnn/` — proper Python src layout replacing flat root-level modules
- Renamed modules to avoid namespace redundancy (e.g. `data_ingestion.py` → `sc2ml.data.ingestion`)
- Updated `pyproject.toml` to src layout (`packages = [{include = "sc2ml", from = "src"}]`)
- Replaced hardcoded `ROOT_PROJECTS_DIR` path with `Path(__file__)` derivation in `config.py`
- Moved logging setup from module-level side effect to `setup_logging()` function in `cli.py`
- Fixed duplicate `perform_feature_engineering()` call in pipeline orchestrator
- Replaced string type annotations with proper `TYPE_CHECKING` imports in GNN modules
- Archived legacy run reports (`01_run.md`–`09_run.md`) to `reports/archive/`
- Translated all Polish comments and log strings to English across all 13 Python modules
- Added type hints to all function signatures (parameters and return types) in all modules
- Extracted 60+ magic numbers into named constants in `config.py`

### Added
- `src/sc2ml/__init__.py` with package version `0.2.0`
- `[project.scripts]` entry point: `sc2ml = "sc2ml.cli:main"`
- `tests/conftest.py` for pytest configuration
- `tests/helpers.py` for shared test utilities (replaces `tests/fixtures.py`)
- `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` in `pyproject.toml`
- `pyproject.toml` with Poetry dependency management
- `config.py` with all centralized constants
- `tests/` directory with test suite (data validation, feature engineering,
  graph construction, model reproducibility)
- CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, and research log

### Removed
- Root-level `__init__.py` (incorrect — root is not a package)
- `tests/fixtures.py` (absorbed into `tests/helpers.py`)
- `sys.path.insert()` hack from all test files
- Unused imports in `cli.py` (data ingestion functions not called in current pipeline)
- Dead commented-out legacy `main()` function block (~100 lines)

### Fixed
- Test fixture now drops non-numeric columns (e.g. `data_build`) before passing to sklearn
- Ruff import sorting and unused import warnings resolved across all modules

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-30 (Baseline)

### Added
- SC2 data ingestion pipeline with manifest tracking (`data_ingestion.py`)
- DuckDB-based data processing with SQL views (`data_processing.py`)
- Feature engineering with 45+ features and Bayesian smoothing (`ml_pipeline.py`)
- Custom ELO rating system with dynamic K-factor (`elo_system.py`)
- Classical ML baselines: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM (`model_training.py`)
- Random Forest hyperparameter tuning via RandomizedSearchCV (`hyperparameter_tuning.py`)
- GATv2-based Graph Neural Network for edge classification (`gnn_model.py`, `gnn_pipeline.py`, `gnn_trainer.py`)
- Node2Vec embedding pipeline (`node2vec_embedder.py`)
- t-SNE visualization of GNN embeddings (`gnn_visualizer.py`)
- Pipeline orchestrator with configurable model selection (`main.py`)
- Execution reports documenting 9 pipeline runs (`reports/`)
