# SC2EGSet Dataset Roadmap

**Game:** SC2
**Dataset:** sc2egset
**Canonical phase list:** `docs/PHASES.md`
**Methodology manuals:** `docs/INDEX.md`
**Step definition schema:** `docs/templates/step_template.yaml`

## How to use this document

This file decomposes Phases into Pipeline Sections and Steps for the sc2egset
dataset. The canonical Phase definitions and Pipeline Section enumerations live
in `docs/PHASES.md`. This ROADMAP does not invent Phases or Pipeline Sections;
it only decomposes them into Steps.

Steps are defined in a planning session before Phase work begins.

Steps are numbered `XX_YY_ZZ` where `XX` = Phase, `YY` = Pipeline Section,
`ZZ` = Step within that Pipeline Section.

## Source data

**SC2EGSet v2.1.0** — StarCraft II Esport Replay and Game-state Dataset.
~22,000 competitive 1v1 replays from 70+ tournaments covering 2016–2024.

and Game-state Dataset.* Scientific Data 10(1), 600.

**Game loop timing:** The SC2 engine runs at 16 game loops per game-second
(Normal speed). All competitive play uses Faster speed (1.4× multiplier),
giving **22.4 game loops = 1 real-time second**. Use `game_loops / 22.4 / 60`
for real-time minutes. The older formula `game_loops / 16.0 / 60` produces
game-minutes (internal engine time) — both are valid but must be clearly
labelled. All artifacts in this ROADMAP use real-time minutes unless
explicitly noted.

## Phase 01 — Data Exploration

Pipeline Sections per `docs/PHASES.md`:

- `01_01` — Data Acquisition & Source Inventory
- `01_02` — Exploratory Data Analysis (Tukey-style)
- `01_03` — Systematic Data Profiling
- `01_04` — Data Cleaning
- `01_05` — Temporal & Panel EDA
- `01_06` — Decision Gates

### Step 01_01_01 — File Inventory

```yaml
step_number: "01_01_01"
name: "File Inventory"
description: "Walk the sc2egset raw directory, count files, measure sizes, group by subdirectory."
phase: "01 — Data Exploration"
pipeline_section: "01_01 — Data Acquisition & Source Inventory"
manual_reference: "01_DATA_EXPLORATION_MANUAL.md, Section 1"
dataset: "sc2egset"
question: "What files exist on disk, how many are there, and how are they organized?"
method: "Call inventory_directory() on the raw directory and on each tournament's _data/ subdirectory. The sc2egset layout is two-level: raw/TOURNAMENT/TOURNAMENT_data/*.SC2Replay.json. Report tournament-level metadata counts, per-_data/ replay counts, total replay files, total size, and summary statistics (min/max/median replays per tournament). Flag tournaments with missing _data/ dirs."
stratification: "By tournament directory (each tournament has its own _data/ subdir)."
predecessors: "none — independent"
notebook_path: "sandbox/sc2/sc2egset/01_exploration/01_acquisition/01_01_01_file_inventory.py"
inputs:
  duckdb_tables: "none — reads filesystem only"
  external_references:
    - ".claude/scientific-invariants.md"
outputs:
  data_artifacts:
    - "artifacts/01_exploration/01_acquisition/01_01_01_file_inventory.json"
  report: "artifacts/01_exploration/01_acquisition/01_01_01_file_inventory.md"
reproducibility: "All counts produced by inventory_directory() from rts_predict.common.inventory. Code and output are in the paired notebook."
scientific_invariants_applied:
  - number: "6"
    how_upheld: "Inventory counts are produced by code in the notebook, saved alongside the report."
  - number: "7"
    how_upheld: "No thresholds used — pure counting."
gate:
  artifact_check: "artifacts/01_exploration/01_acquisition/01_01_01_file_inventory.json and .md exist and are non-empty."
  continue_predicate: "Inventory artifacts exist on disk."
  halt_predicate: "Raw directory does not exist or is empty."
thesis_mapping:
  - "Chapter 4 — Data and Methodology > 4.1.1 SC2EGSet (StarCraft II)"
research_log_entry: "Required on completion."

## Phase 07 — Thesis Writing Wrap-up (gate marker)

dataset have reached FINAL status in `thesis/WRITING_STATUS.md`.
